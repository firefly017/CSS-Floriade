    <h1>Floriade Expo 2022 in the city of Almere</h1>
    <h2>When you think of the word ‘horticulture’, what comes to mind?</h2>
    <p>
      It is not surprising that you would think of words such as ‘shrubs, ‘rake’
      or ‘vegetable gardens’. Terms such as ‘sustainability’, ‘liveability’ and
      ‘a hopeful future’ probably come to mind less quickly, understandably so.
      The horticultural sector rarely gets the attention it deserves. A pity,
      because horticulture is amazing! Above all it is essential to our common
      future.

      Once every ten years, all the horticultural greats gather during this
      International Horticultural Exhibition. Experts from all over the world
      come together at Floriade to present green solutions that make our cities
      more enjoyable, beautiful and sustainable. Within the theme ‘Growing Green
      Cities’, more than 400 national and international participants showcase
      their latest green innovations, solutions and applications. From
      state-of-the-art solar roof tiles to amazing vertical façade gardens and
      from the best ways to grow tomatoes to the latest pruning techniques. You
      can see, taste and experience it all at Floriade.

      Floriade inspires you to live greener and healthier. After a day at the
      Expo you will go home inspired and full of ideas. For example, how you can
      enrich your own garden, balcony or living room. In this way you too can
      contribute to the green city of the future!

      Does this sound like music to your ears? Then travel to the greenest and
      healthiest city of our country: Almere. From spring 2022 Floriade and
      Almere will be the flourishing centre of the Netherlands for six months.
      We believe you will love it here so much that you won’t want to leave.
      Fortunately, Floriade lays the foundation for the future sustainable urban
      district ‘Hortus’, so who knows…
