        When you think of the word ‘horticulture’, what comes to mind?
      </h2>
      <p class="infoText">
        It is not surprising that you would think of words such as ‘shrubs,
        ‘rake’ or ‘vegetable gardens’. Terms such as ‘sustainability’,
        ‘liveability’ and ‘a hopeful future’ probably come to mind less quickly,
        understandably so. The horticultural sector rarely gets the attention it
        deserves. A pity, because horticulture is amazing! Above all it is
        essential to our common future.

        Once every ten years, all the horticultural greats gather during this
        International Horticultural Exhibition. Experts from all over the world
        come together at Floriade to present green solutions that make our
        cities more enjoyable, beautiful and sustainable. Within the theme
        ‘Growing Green Cities’, more than 400 national and international
        participants showcase their latest green innovations, solutions and
        applications. From state-of-the-art solar roof tiles to amazing vertical
        façade gardens and from the best ways to grow tomatoes to the latest
        pruning techniques. You can see, taste and experience it all at
        Floriade.

        Floriade inspires you to live greener and healthier. After a day at the
        Expo you will go home inspired and full of ideas. For example, how you
        can enrich your own garden, balcony or living room. In this way you too
        can contribute to the green city of the future!

        Does this sound like music to your ears? Then travel to the greenest and
        healthiest city of our country: Almere. From spring 2022 Floriade and
        Almere will be the flourishing centre of the Netherlands for six months.
        We believe you will love it here so much that you won’t want to leave.
        Fortunately, Floriade lays the foundation for the future sustainable
        urban district ‘Hortus’, so who knows…
